The consequent land use changes, particularly urbanization, have resulted in the loss of wetlands, alteration of freshwater inflows, contamination of water, sediments and biota, and declines of fish and wildlife species.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has maintained a broad program of multi-disciplinary research studies, both fundamental and applied, in the San Francisco Bay estuary and its watershed. The studies help us understand the extent and impact of these changes, as they also help decision-makers use science to help mitigate adverse effects. USGS studies often are conducted in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies, and have been designed to increase our understanding of important issues.
